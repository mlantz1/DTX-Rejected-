## Running the Server

### Running the Server Locally

To run the flask data server, be sure python is installed and also flask and requests python modules.
In the man folder, execute:

`./run_local.sh`

If you are running on a Windows machine, execute this in git bash or some other program providing bash functionallity. It is possible that the path to flask is different on Windows. If so, try `which flask` in your bash terminal to find the path. Create a new file for running on Windows copied from `run.sh` and replace the path with your Windows path.

If you do not want to use the script to run, use the following commands:

`export FLASK_APP=app.py`

`flask run`

### Pushing to Predix

To push to Predix, use the script

`./push_remote`

Again, if you are on Windows, you may need to create another script with a different path.

If you do not want to use the script, the commands are

`px login`

`px push`


## Configurations

### Tech Stack

We are using flask in python to serve up data from the backend and to serve html. Javascript is being used in the html to retrieve data from the backend to accomplish continuous updating. Style sheets are using bootstrap. Persistent data storage has not yet been decided on.

### Directory Structure

The files `app.py` and `app.pyc` should be in root (if `app.pyc` does not exist, running the project will create it). All back-end python files will be collected in a folder still to be created. All front-end files belong in `/static/` if they are html and in `/static/scripts/` if they are something else. Html pages will be linked together with hardcoded links.

### Python Dependencies

Use pip to install dependencies. The command `pip install [module]` will auto-install the module. The necessary modules are:

`requests`

`apscheduler`
